<div id="breif-intro">

**Hello Dear readers**, I know you've stumbled upon this repo and aksed your self what is this, well let me take the time and opportunity to explain what this app does.

</div>

<div id="intro-part2">

Hashenger is a new way for people to communicate and talk to each other, with hashenger you can talk to your friends and family without having to worry about your security or privacy, or even limits to what the app can do, hashenger got you covered on those part, you can use hashenger to share your favourite gifs, videos and images(but this feature is comming soon). You can share messages to your friends and family.

</div>

<div id="intro-part2">

Hashenger takes security even further by using a chat-id that you've created. With this chat-id share it with someone and they'll hop in on the chat within seconds.

</div>

<div id="question">

## Why choose chat-ID

Well chat-id's are unique and are more secured than having using your google account, plus with our chat-id we give you control of anything that happen, meaning you can kick someone out from your chat, limit what they can say or do, or even have many people join your chatbase.
